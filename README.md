# Mushroom Classification

A project, currently prototyped in octave, to use machine learning to classify a mushroom as poisonous/edible using the mushroom dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository which can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification).

# Things to Note

A virtual environment should be used to work on the project. Once the virtual environment is setup a `paths.pth` should be added to the virtual environments `site-packages` folder. This should contain the absolute path to the `src` folder for the project.
